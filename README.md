# PerfectImageSignsApp
This project is a custom web application for Perfect Image Signs in Houston, TX. They are a marketing company that promotes various businesses through the use of billboards and other signage in the Houston area.  The owner wanted a simple, but high-level interface app to assist the inputing and managing of data for signs that were recently installed.  Essentially he wanted a method to post sign data that would automatically catergoize the posting by date and company name. The high-level interface is exploited to reduce as much overhead as possible for inputing data.

'
The employee posting the sign just needs to input a picture file, company name and description for the sign. The app will then use the employee's phone's geolocation data to store user's coordinates. Pictures are able to be uploaded from the user's camera roll or taken through browser. Moment.js is used to automatically store the posting's current date. As requested by the owner, sign data is able is stored and is able to be viewed through the 2 different catergoizations: date and company name postings. When viewing postings through either method, users can see the signs' pinpoint locations on a Google Maps' window via stored longitude and latitude coordinates.  They can also see the image of the sign that was posted.'

This project was one of my first freelancing experiences where I was able to practice building a full-stack website from the ground up and reinvent the wheel a bit when it comes to building a CMS.

Technology used: Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bundle.io, JQuery, Google Maps API, HTML5 Geolocation API'
